# Investigating Netflix movies using python

Suppose, we suspect that movies are getting shorter and we've found some initial evidence of this. Having peaked our interest, we will perform exploratory data analysis on the netflix_data.csv data to understand what may be contributing to movies getting shorter over time.

We'll aim to discover if Netflix's movies are getting shorter over time using everything from lists and loops to pandas and matplotlib. We'll also gain experience in an essential data science skill — exploratory data analysis.
